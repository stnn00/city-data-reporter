# city-data-reporter

A Python command-line tool that fetches real-time weather data for any city, displays key information in clear terminal output, exports raw data to a CSV file, and securely loads the OpenWeatherMap API key from a `.env` file.

All functionality is contained in a single Python Script: `reporter.py`
